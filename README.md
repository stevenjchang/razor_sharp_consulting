I came to what I thought was a logical stopping point.

Had I gone further, my next steps would have been:

- validate the input has a valid hex code
  - if invalid, display error to user
- standardized hex codes to lowercase (or refactor helper to handle upper case). As I'm typing this I'm actually realizing this is probably the better choice.

My utils/index.js is a bit of a mess. I used it as a codepen/playground. I first wrote the addHex() iteratively, to make sure I understood how to properly add hexadecimals. I decided to leave it in, kind of as a “show your work” thing.
